## Transformer Conformal Prediction for Time Series

This repository contains codes for implementing models and reproducing the results in our paper ["Transformer Conformal Prediction for Time Series"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05332)

    Transformer Conformal Prediction for Time Series
        Junghwan Lee, Chen Xu, and Yao Xie
        ICML 2024 Workshop on Structured Probabilistic Inference & Generative Modeling
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05332

### Installation
The codes were written in Python 3.9.13. If you want to implement locally,

1. Clone this repository
2. Move to the directory where you clone this repository and install requirements using pip

        pip install -r requirements.txt

### Experiments
We also provide colab notebook for reproducing the results.

#### Simulation: time series with heteroscedastic errors
